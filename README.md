Help! I've fallen and I can't get up!

## Introduction 

This is a new talk selected for the upcoming DDD North 2025 which will be at Hull University on 22nd February. 
This is about how we debug and solve problems, but also about how we, as programmers live inside our own heads a lot of the time, and how we can catch ourselves when we fall into 
unproductive patterns of thought.
