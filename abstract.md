# Abstract

We developers spend our lives going from "Everything is terrible" to "I'm awesome!" and back again, often more than once in the same day. Occasionally, we can find ourselves stuck either 
in old, unfamiliar code, with a bug, a broken test, or just general overwhelm of too much to do in too little time.

Let's talk about strategies to recognize when that is happening, some ways to get unstuck when you don't know where to go or how to get there.

We developers spend our lives going from "Everything is terrible" to "I'm awesome!" and back again, often more than once in the same day. We often find ourselves 
with too much to do in too little time; stuck on understanding old, unfamiliar code; a bug that doesn't make sense; a broken test or a test that should be failing but isn't.

Let's talk about strategies to recognize when this is happening and some ways to get unstuck when you don't know where to go or how to get there.
